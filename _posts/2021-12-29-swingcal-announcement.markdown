# About the Course
For over ten years, SwingCal has taught Berkeley students how to swing dance in a fun and relaxed environment. The class teaches the history of swing dance and music, as well as the modern swing culture that now exists all over the world, bringing a greater context and significance to the moves that we teach. We meet once a week, we have three short take home assignments per semester, there are two dropped absences, and no partner is required! At SwingCal we focus on making dancing a stress free experience since swing is all about being comfortable in your personality and showing it through your dancing. We'd love to have you join our family!
